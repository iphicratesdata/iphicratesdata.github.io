title: Welcome and Introduction
---

   Welcome and thank you for taking the time to visit this website .   I thought that I would use this first post as an introductory writing explaining where I hope the direction of these logs go , as well as where certain inspiration and motivations came from that caused me to create this blog. 
   
   When deciding to create this blog I wanted to do something of real substance, something that could help others on their own journey, but also not to parrot the same over saturated garbage you see at every corner of the internet. The topics should be explored from new angles but yet practical and simplistic in nature with nuance. 
   
   Firstly, I wanted to remain anonymous for obvious and less obvious reasons.  Mostly anonymity would protect my identity but also because I did not want my identity to be attached to the words and content, I wanted them to stand-alone on their own merit. 
   
   The direction of this site first begins with understanding the universal truth of how the way an individual thinks and cultivates their mind is EVERYTHING, as it is how our reality takes form.  After understanding this truth we can then further expand on what is the best and most effective path in elevating and refining our minds to construct reality.
   
   In the era of self-help gurus and ego inflated social media moguls, it is hard to see what the correct endeavor is in the human experience.  This website is dedicated to pursuing the path of higher consciousness , by way of Martial Arts and meditation training and philosophy; as well as learning from world and military history, and any other sources of information which compliment the pursuit of this path.  While there is a primary focus to this blog, it is not limited to any one thing, and plan on venturing into other topics which aid in the progression.
   
   Since I acquired much of my inspiration from martial arts and meditation (mostly zen) practice,  I wanted the title of the blog/site to incorporate this sentiment.  This is how the website’s name, “Mind of No-Mind”, came to fruition. 
   
   The phrase , “the mind of no-mind” is in reference to one of the ways of saying in english, “ mushin no shin”, from Japanese, found in Zen & Martial arts, describing a state of being and mind.  It represents a mental state in which a martial artist enters during combat, where the mind is completely awake and aware, neither fixed nor preoccupied by any thoughts or emotions.  While being completely free and detached from ones ego; a state of flow is achieved during live combat  ( a whole separate post will be dedicated to these concepts and state of mind).   This dedication serves as motivation and inspiration to anyone who wishes to follow a path, that comes close to even resembling such fortitude.
   
   The magnitude of most likely a life long quest of martial arts mastery, meditation and eradicating one’s ego and attachment, is an immeasurable feat, and difficult to comprehend in today’s society.  Especially where in our current culture, where success can be defined to how much “likes” one can accumulate on any given multitude of social media platforms. 
   
   Due to this web log focusing a great deal on martial arts training,  I think this initial post would be good to time to mention an immensely overlooked issue which is plaguing the martial arts world of today.
   
   It is paramount to understand that when martial arts training is discussed throughout this site, it is with indication , of training that MUST consist of hard and aggressive live sparring from a fully resisting opponent/training partner.
   
   Without hard, full resistance training it really is not the practice of true martial arts.  However, do not be mistaken with drilling movement and situational training, along with conceptual understanding/theory , and perhaps even psychology , as these are all major components of martial training.
   
   Part of martial arts is discovering oneself under the extreme circumstance of immediate physical harm, and/or danger, and still being able to remain calm and perform under such pressures.
   
   As any potential reader of this blog, it is very evident for them to see how deep the rabbit hole can go for exploring such subject matter.  I truly believe that if I can even scratch the surface of these topics, or at least give them the proper representation to give them justice,  I would be satisfied with such content.  However that being said,  I hope to do much more through the development and progression of this sites direction.  I hope readers can find something to take from these explorations and writings.  
   
   
   OSS.
